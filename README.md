# Fobos project
# Embedded software for project Fobos (master).
Communicates with PC via ethernet (TCP/IP) and with controller via CAN-bus, analyzes sensors. It uses FreeRTOS.
# Embedded software for Universal controller (slave) also includes in the project.
Controller uses non-unique embedded software (a lot of universal controller could use this embedded software). Uses FreeRTOS.
Board analyzes 8+4 DigIO pins (24v 8 inputs/ 4 outputs)
# Schematics are also in the project.
